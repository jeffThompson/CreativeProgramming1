# COLLAGE  

### TLDR  
* A collage made of photographs  
* Consider the poetic, narrative, and/or political meaning of your source images  
* Finished collage due Oct 27 by 11am EST  
* Upload `jpg` image to Canvas and include a link to your `p5.js` code as a comment  


### ASSIGNMENT  
>"Sometimes I consider myself a fisherman. Computer programs and ideas are the hooks, rods, and reels. Computer pictures are the trophies and delicious meals. A fisherman does not always know what the waters will yield... Often the specific catch is a surprise."
>— Clifford Pickover, *Computers, Pattern, Chaos, and Beauty* (1990)

So far we've only used drawing commands in `p5.js` – rectangles, lines, circles, etc. And while those ideas still underpin all the things we do with computer graphics, dealing only with geometric shapes would miss out on so many other things! When we think about digital images, photographs are probably what first come to mind. We upload more than [1.8 billion photographs per day to the internet!](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/how-many-photographs-of-you-are-out-there-in-the-world/413389/) Working with photographs using code can be really exciting but can also get very complex (we'll talk lots more about image filters, processing, and even extracting information from images in CP2). But as a starting point, we'll make collages using photographs.

Your first step will be gathering source images to work with: think about these images as both a source of color and texture as well as having the potential to add meaningful context to your image. Images of forests might create a serene feeling, but adding images of fires and pollution creates another layer of meaning. Google Image Search will be a good place to start, but also consider taking your own photos, scanning objects, etc to get the source material you want!

Once you have images to work with, use the tools we've covered so far to make a collage that layers these images (or parts of them) into a new composition. Think about structures like for-loops that will let you tile images or create repeating patterns. Randomness may also be a useful tool, though you don't have to use it if you'd prefer a more controlled composition. You might also want to think about what steps to carry out in code and what to do with other tools: for example, it may make more sense to crop or mask an image in Photoshop by hand before importing it to your sketch, rather than trying to do it with code.

### INSPIRATION  
* Anna Opperman's room-scale collage installations  
* George Braque and Pablo Picasso's early Cubist collages using newspaper and other found materials  
* Hadieh Shafie's collages made by drawing patterns on paper, then cutting them up  
* Dadist collage artists Hannah Hoch, Kurt Schwitters, and Raoul Haussmann who used images from magazines and books  
* Joseph Cornell's enigmatic 3D collages  
* Photo collages by Linder and Martha Rosler  
* Paintings use collage imagery by Nathaniel Mary Quinn and Robert Rauschenberg

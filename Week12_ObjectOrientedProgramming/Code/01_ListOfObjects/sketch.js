LIST OF OBJECTS
Jeff Thompson | 2017/20 | jeffreythompson.org

One of the benefits of OOP is that we can define a template
for an object, then make multiple instances of it.

Imagine a code-generated rabbit: using the methods we've
covered before now, each rabbit would need an x/y position,
direction of motion, etc. You'd end up with a mess of variables
like rabbitX1, rabbitX2, etc.

With classes, this gets a little simpler: we'd have a bunch
of instances of the Rabbit class. But if we wanted to have
dozens or hundreds of rabbits, this would face a similar
problem. We'd have rabbit1, rabbit2, etc and, to display them,
we'd have to call display() on each one â€“ too messy!

But, we can create lists of objects too! We can add them, remove
them, and use a for-loop to iterate through the list to
update, display, and otherwise work with each instance.

Here, we create an array of Rabbit objects and randomly
spawn new rabbits to join their friends.

CHALLENGES:
1. Can you give the rabbits a little shadow beneath them?
2. Can you make the rabbits grow in size the older they get?
   Hint: add a variable for their length to the class.

  // create new rabbits (how many is specified by the)
  // 'numRabbits' variable above

    // create a new Rabbit in a random location
    // (we pass the x/y values to the constructor as arguments)
    let x = random(width);
    let y = random(height);
    let r = new Rabbit(x, y);

    // then add the rabbit to the list
    rabbits.push(r);

  background(15, 190, 25);

  // each frame, go through all the rabbits:
  // update their positions and draw them onscreen

    let r = rabbits[i];
    r.update();
    r.display();

      this.direction = -1;
    }
    else {
      this.direction = 1;

  // make them run!
  // (if they hit the edges, reverse direction)
  update() {
    this.x += this.speedX;

      this.speedX *= -1;

      this.speedY *= -1;

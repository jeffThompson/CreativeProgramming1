# ANIMATION  

### TLDR  
* Make a sketch that includes three animated "scenes" that play automatically and include sound  
* Should run the full size of the browser window  
* Work-in-progress sketch with rough versions of at least two scenes due Nov 17 by 11am EST; upload a screenshot of each scene to Canvas  
* Finished sketch due Nov 24 by 11am EST  
* Upload two screenshots of each scene to Canvas  


### ASSIGNMENT  
Building on the ideas of interactivity we explored in the last assignment, as our last regular project your task is to create an animation in `p5.js` with three scenes and should include sound. While doing Pixar-level animation (or even cell animation like Looney Toons) is not really possible with the tools we have, we can explore motion, time, and change by making shapes and images move. Even with these simple tools you can make complex, rich, surprising, and visually-exciting animations!

For some prompts to consider, see the `Resources` folder for this week. This includes artist Richard Serra's *Verb List* as well as a list of verbs in the English language and some musical terms that describe change and flow.

Overall, please keep your animations to under 3 minutes! Shorter is fine too, but think about giving scenes enough time to unfold and for us to get into them.

**SCENES**  
Your three "scenes" should be distinct parts that come one after another and should be triggered automatically. This might be based on a `millis()` or `frameCount` timer, or a condition being met (like an object reaching a certain point or an audio file ending). You should think about your sketch as a generative film: scenes that feel like parts of a cohesive whole. This might mean they build towards some kind of climax, are visually related or contrast with each other, etc. Think about the examples shown for ideas on what that might look like.

**SOUND**  
Your animation should also include at least one sound. This can be background music/environmental sounds, sound effects triggered by different events, ambient sound, etc. Think about how sound creates a sense of space, context and flow (or contrasts or contradicts what we see visually). You can pull sounds from some of the websites listed in the `Resources` section below or record them yourself!

Made in 1961 using a decommissioned WW2-era M-5 Antiaircraft Gun Director, "Catalog" is what its name implies: a catalog of visual effects at the birth of computer graphics.

* See the `AnimationTemplate` in the examples for a starting point  


### DELIVERABLES  
* Animation with at least three scenes  
  * Includes at least one sound (music or sound effects)  
  * Starts either automatically (if you don't have background sound) or via a user interaction like a click  
  * Automatically switches to the next scene  
  * Runs fullscreen using `createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)` (so you'll want to use `width` and `height` as much as possible)
* Two screenshots of each scene, documenting the piece

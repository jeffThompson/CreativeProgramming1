## MUSICAL "CHARACTERS"  
Via [Alan Blekin](http://alanbelkinmusic.com/site/en/index.php/orchestration-character-glossary):  

|   |   |
|---|---|
Luminous|This character requires two elements: a soft background, usually sustained strings, and another element to add "light."
Mysterious|Mystery comes from lack of clarity. Appropriate sounds include very delicate background resonance (sustained sound) and/or very quiet movement, not too thickly spaced.
Menacing|Certain sounds, often starting softly and making a crescendo, which evoke natural threats (e.g. earthquakes, eruptions) are very potent.
Terrifying, angry|Loud and piercing sounds, which often resemble animal cries, harsh and strident.
Brilliant|Often suggests a certain virtuosity, speed.
Splendid, rich, triumphant|Requires a mass of instruments, suggesting generosity and richness
Dramatic|Sudden contrasts in register, timbre, and dynamics.
Funereal|Heavy, dragging sounds, suggesting a mourning procession.
Playful, funny|The key here is lightness, unless a grotesque effect is wanted.
Sad, melancholy, poignant|Often suggests an individual (solo) lamenting, or discouragement, weakness.

ANIMATION BASICS: ROTATION
Jeff Thompson | 2019/20 | jeffreythompson.org

Animation is the appearance of motion, created by
a sequence of frames where objects change position,
rotation, etc. Complex animation, like a Disney movie,
requires immensely complex software and math. But the
basics are actually pretty easy and we can do a lot
with the tools we've already covered.

In this example, we rotate an object around its axis,
but the real power is in combining transformations, 
drawing commands, design considerations, and layers 
of animation!

CHALLENGES:
1. Can you make the outside squares rotate as a group
   around the center square?
2. Can you have the squares rotate 360ยบ then reverse
   direction? (Hint: see the 'Animation Basics: 
   Position' example)

*/

// angle of rotation: the parameter that we'll animate!
let angle = 0;


function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}


function draw() {
  background(50);

  // we'll be drawing a square in the center
  // of our sketch that rotates around itself
  push();
  translate(width/2, height/2);

  // the angle of rotation is what we're animating
  // (ie changing over time) so first we'll increase
  // its value and then rotate to that angle
  angle += radians(1);
  rotate(angle);

  // try changing the amount we add to the angle
  // and see how the animation changes!
  // (hint: we can think of this as 'speed')

  // then draw the square
  fill(255);
  noStroke();
  rectMode(CENTER);
  square(0,0, 150);
  pop();

  // a slightly fancier addition, but really this
  // just builds on what we did above!
  // we use a for-loop to create a ring of
  // squares 30ยบ degrees apart around the center
  for (let a=0; a<radians(360); a+=radians(30)) {
    push();
    translate(width/2, height/2);   // move origin to center
    rotate(a);                      // rotate each by 30ยบ
    translate(0, 200);              // then offset vertically
    rotate(-angle);                 // spin around the other way!
    rectMode(CENTER);
    square(0,0, 50);
    pop();
  }
}

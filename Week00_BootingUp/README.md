# BOOTING UP  

### TLDR  
* Due September 8 by 11am EST  
* Make a drawing using instructions you create  
* Upload a photo or scan of your drawing to Canvas  
* Type the instructions used to create it as a comment on your submission  
* Read *Computer Graphics* by Manfred Mohr and write a 1-paragraph response (also as a comment)  


### ASSIGNMENT  

> "The idea becomes a machine that makes the art." – Sol LeWitt  

As a way to start thinking about writing code, but without the hassle of learning syntax and finding missing semicolons, we're going to make some drawings ~together~ using instructions that define what marks we can make and where they go. This mimics a few things that happen when we run code: instructions are carried out exactly as they are written, that suprising things can result from limited instructions, and that there is a rich and interesting tradition of artists and designers working this way. 

Using our in-class work as inspiration, create a more involved drawing using instructions you create. You will want to experiment and test what different instructions and variations will do – this is called "iterative development" and is exactly what we'll do when we start writing code! You can make your drawing collaboratively or by yourself. 

The goal is a much more fully-developed drawing that produces surprising results and feels finished. The drawings should fill an `8.5x11"` sheet of paper or larger (`larger == better`, probably), and should include a separate set of written instructions. Consider also the presentation of your drawing and instructions: keep everything neat and clean, select drawing implements that make sense for your particular instructions, fonts for the instruction sheet, etc.

Lastly, please also read Manfred Mohr's *Computer Graphics* essay in the `Readings` folder and write a one-paragraph response, posted as a comment on your drawing's submission on Canvas. Think about the drawings we made in class together and Mohr's essay: how does making art through instructions differ from other ways you've made things before? Are you excited by the idea of instructions defining a creative process? What is the role of intuition in this process? Is anything gained or lost making in this way?


### DELIVERABLES    
* A drawing made following your instructions, filling at least `8.5x11"`  
* Drawing uploaded to the assignment on Canvas (either a photo or scan), with your instructions typed up as a comment on your submission  

:warning: **If you have any problems with Canvas or the assignment, don't hesitate to email me or drop into my Zoom hours! Since we'll be working with technical material (and will be nearly all online this semester) it's important you be proactive in getting help. Don't be shy!**


### STRETCH GOALS  
If you get really excited about your instruction drawing, here's a few things you can try:

* Carry out the instructions a few different times and see how the results differ (they may also form a nice [diptych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diptych) or [triptych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triptych))  
* Ask other people to do a drawing from your instructions and compare the results  


### IN-CLASS DRAWINGS  
Below are some of the exercises we did together in class (though normally we'd be doing them together in groups on paper!) – the first few are inspired by [Zach Lieberman](http://thesystemis.com). In all of these, it's best not to think too much, just make marks quickly and see what results from the accumulation!

1. Draw a dot in a point that is as far from the other dots as possible. Repeat many times and as quickly as possible.  

2. From the end of an existing line, draw a straight line of any length and angle. Then add a new straight line somewhere else on the page. No lines should touch any other. Repeat.  

3. Draw a blob (random, round-ish shape) of any size that intersects with another blob but doesn't touch any others. Repeat.  

4. Draw a curving line from the edge of the paper inwards. No lines should touch. Repeat.  

5. Modified version of Sol LeWitt's `WORK FROM INSTRUCTIONS (1971)`:  
`WITHIN EACH ONE INCH SQUARE, DRAW NOTHING,`  
`OR DRAW A DIAGONAL STRAIGHT LINE FROM CORNER TO CORNER,`  
`OR TWO CROSSING STRAIGHT LINES DIAGONALLY FROM CORNER TO CORNER`  

6. On a sheet of scratch paper (or your computer) write a set of simple instructions about what to do from the points you see here. When ready, start carrying out the instructions onscreen. It's totally ok if you get lost while others are drawing too!


### INSPIRATION  
Each week, we'll look at examples of historical and contemporary makers who use code or whose work relates to the ideas we're talking about. They'll be shown with commentary in the assignment's video, but you can also find links in this section and (some of) the images in each week's `Images` folder:

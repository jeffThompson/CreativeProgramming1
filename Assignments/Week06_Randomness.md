RANDOMNESS
====

### DUE: THURSDAY, OCT 19/26

> "The computer is a unique device for the arts since it can function soley as an obedient tool with vast capabilities for controlling complicated and involved processes, but then again, full exploitation of its unique talents for controlled randomness and detailed algorithms could result in an entirely new machine – a creative artistic medium." – A. Michael Noll (1970)

For this project, we'll look at how randomness can be a creative tool, both breaking the computer's determinism and taking advantage of its capacity to quickly create ([seemingly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness)) random values. Your assignment for the next two weeks is to explore randomness from a creative standpoint and create a PDF image that we will print and hang in the hall as a small exhibition.

Since your code is going to generate different output every time it's run, when your sketch is finished (and while working too) you'll want to run it many times and keep the best outputs. This can be exciting if not a little weird: it removes your artistic hand somewhat, leaving you to act as coordinator (writing code) and curator (selecting output to show).

### STRETCH GOALS  
Try adding these elements to your sketch:

* Can you add the random parameters automatically to your exported filename, so you could recreate the image?  
* Could you use a hardware-based random number generation method (dice, coin toss, an algorithm of your own devising) to use as the `randomSeed()` every time you run your program? How could that be wrapped into the conceptual idea of your project?  
* Try using `randomSeed()` and the mouse coordinates to make an interactive generator.

### FOR THURSDAY, OCTOBER 19  
For next week, you should create a series of five or more exploratory code studies thinking about randomness. These should show a range of ideas, and explore potential directions for the project. These should be the same size/format as the final sketch (`1152x720 pixels`), exported as PDFs, and printed on a laser printer (either in the Lab or at Kinkos, etc). Bring your prints to class next week – remember that presentation counts, so keep your prints crisp and clean. 

### FOR THURSDAY, OCTOBER 26  
For next week, please take the studies you did and the feedback received, and re-work one (or a combination) into a final version. This should be printed on a laser printer and brought to class. See the **Project Requirements** below for the full details.

### PROJECT REQUIREMENTS  
* Five or more exploratory studies, exported and printed.  
* Sketch should be `1152x720 pixels` (that's `16x10" * 72 pixels per inch`) and printed on `11x17"` paper with a `0.5"` margin all around. Either orientation is ok. You can also make your sketch larger and shrink it to fit, if the proportions are the same.  
* Run lots of times until you have two different PDFs you're happy with.  
* Name your sketch `LastnameFirstname_Interactivity`  
* Zip your code, studies, and final PDFs and upload to Canvas.  
* **Be sure to check if Python is installed and working for you, or plan to use the Lab computers for our next project.**

* If you have a week free to hide out a read a (giant) novel about randomness, Neal Stephenson's [*Cryptonomicon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptonomicon) is excellent  

### GRADING RUBRIC  
Your project will be graded with the following rubric:

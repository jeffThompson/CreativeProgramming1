DRAWING APP
====

### DUE: TUESDAY, MARCH 7

This week, your assignment is to build a drawing app in Processing. Think about all the concepts (iteration, recursion, etc) and tools we've looked at so far this semester, and about about how you can create interesting and novel interaction to make drawings. Can you trigger different drawing styles with the keyboard? What might spacebar plus the mouse do? Could you build a drawing application that doesn't follow the usual convention of mouse input? What would the most impossible, delicate, ephemeral, or out of control drawing app look like? Remember that the drawings your app is capable of making is as important, if not more, than how the app itself works. Great code + boring drawings = boring art. 

In addition to the app itself, you'll need two more things:  

* Be sure to build a way of saving from your sketch – when done, create and save at least two drawings to show off your app.  
* Create a set of instructions for your application – this should be saved as a Word or PDF file in your sketch, and printed for class.

### STRETCH GOALS  
Try adding these elements to your sketch:

* How can you combine the keyboard and mouse for more complex, rich interaction? Could the basic drawing tool be modified by the keyboard in some way?  
* Can you document your drawing app and create a Github repository for it as an open source project?  

### TURNING IN  
Your finished drawing application sketch, at least two completed drawings made using it, and your instructions should be zipped and named `FirstnameLastname_DrawingApp` and uploaded to Canvas.

RECURSION EXPERIMENTS
====

### DUE: THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 28

>"To understand recursion, one must first understand recursion." – Stephen Hawking

You've now seen the visual power of recursion, capable of building intricate structures that would be impossible to code any other way. Natural forms like trees, ferns, coral, and sea slugs show these kinds of patterns, as do [fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) – images that have a repeating pattern that is visible at every scale. This branching, infinitely expanding characteristic is called "self similarity" and isn't just mathematically useful, but also visually exciting.

Your assignment for next week is to create an exciting image using recursion. Play is key here: start writing code, make changes, see what happens. This is a lot like the process of painting or sculpting. Just because we're using code doesn't mean you have to know exactly what you're doing ahead of time. The main criteria here is the visual – strive to create a striking, surprising image that is beautiful, complex, ugly, psychedelic, etc. Be bold and experiment!

As with all of our projects, being inspired by the code of others is great, but I'd much rather you make something simple that is your own. Minor changes (like variables or colors) to existing code won't count, unless you hack it completely beyond recognition.

Saving versions will be super helpful! Any time you start making a major change, save a version of your project so you can go back in time, in case you break something or want to iterate in another direction. You may also want to take notes, either in comments in the code or in your sketchbook, to keep track of variable settings.

**Your sketch should be at least 800x800 pixels (larger is ok too) and exported as a png file, then everything zipped and uploaded to Canvas, just like last week.**

### STRETCH GOALS  
Try adding these elements to your sketch:

* No need for just one function – can you make several that draw on top of one another?  
* Can you use the recursive function to drive changes in color as well? What about if statements inside that change depending on the state of a variable?  
* Playing and sketching with code, without always understanding what it is doing, is great and artistically satisfying. But, can you unpack what your code is doing and add detailed comments to explain it?  

### PROJECTS SHOWN  
* Ian Burns' 1968 book [*Xerox #1*](http://p-dpa.tumblr.com/post/107006084937/xerox-book-1-ian-burn-1968-a-blank-sheet-of), photocopying a blank sheet of paper 100 times  
* Alvin Lucier's [*I Am Sitting In A Room*](http://www.ubu.com/sound/lucier.html) – you can [read more about this piece](https://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2015/01/20/collecting-alvin-luciers-i-am-sitting-in-a-room/), and how MoMA acquired it  
* The amazing meme-recursion of [*Pardon me*](https://recursivelyrecursive.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/pardon-me-come-again/) (lots more info [here](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pardon-me))  
* Plus lots of fractals, creatures, and GIFs – find them in this week's `Images` folder  

### RESOURCES  
* In `Readings > Week03` you'll find a PDF of *Snowflakes*, a book from 1863 with lots of amazing drawings  
* For visual inspiration, consider looking to nature for recursive patterns like ice crystals, broccoli, coral, sea urchin shells, and slime mold  
* Some programming languages don't have any iteration (like for loops) but do everything with recursion – examples include [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29) and [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_%28programming_language%29)  
* Read more about the history of recursion in computer science from two papers (also in the `Readings` folder)  

### TURNING IN  
To turn in your project, zip your sketch's folder (with the code and png file in it). To zip a folder:

* Right-click the sketch folder...  
* On Mac, click `Compress...` to zip  
* On PC, click `Send To > Compressed...`

Rename to `LastnameFirstname_RECURSION.zip` and upload to Canvas before the start of class.

### GRADING RUBRIC  
Your project will be graded with the following rubric:

**10%:** Project meets technical requirements (correct file format, naming convention, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows creativity, attention to visual quality (composition, color, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows clear use of technical material covered in class  
**30%:** Project shows investigation and exploration of assignment topic

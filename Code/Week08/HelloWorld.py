HELLO WORLD
Jeff Thompson | 2017 | jeffreythompson.org

The most basic Python script – print the words "Hello,
world!" to the command line.

RUNNING YOUR SCRIPT
1.	Save your script with the .py extension.
2.	Open the command line program for your OS:

		Mac:     Applications > Utilities > Terminal
		Windows: Start > Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt

3.	Navigate to the folder with your script using the cd (change
	directory) command:

		cd path/to/your/script

	On the Mac, you can also drag the folder icon into the Terminal,
	so you don't have to type out the full path!

4. Run it!

		python HelloWorld.py

'''

print 'Hello, world!'

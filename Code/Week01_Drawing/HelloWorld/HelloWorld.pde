HELLO, WORLD!
Jeff Thompson | 2016 | jeffreythompson.org

Since the mid-1970s, it has been traditional that the first
program one learns to write is to have the computer
display the text "Hello, World!" (either to the screen, or
on some older systems, actually printed via a teletype).

The origin isn't entirely clear, but one possible source is
Brian Kernighan, an engineer at Bell Labs where the seminal
C language was developed. If you want to really nerd out,
you can read this giant collection of "Hello, World" examples
here: http://helloworldcollection.de

Not only is this our first program, but it also demonstrates
the very useful println() function, which lets us display
text in the console. This is helpful for debugging purposes,
especially when working on larger or interactive projects.

(We're also seeing here a multiline comment – text that isn't
code but used as notes – and a single-line comment below!)

void setup() {
  
  // the println() command displays ("prints") text
  // to the console below; it takes as an "argument"
  // a "string" (text) denoted by quotes
  
  println("Hello, world!");
  
  // all commands in Processing require a semicolon
  // at the end – try running without and see what happens
  
  // try printing some other text, using separate
  // println() commands!
  
}

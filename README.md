# CREATIVE PROGRAMMING 1

**[:arrow_down: Jump right to the Course Calendar :arrow_down:](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CreativeProgramming1#course-calendar)**  
 
| Instructor     | Prof. Jeff Thompson (please call me Jeff) |  
| :---           | :--- |  
| Email          | jeff.thompson@stevens.edu |  
| Time/location  | Mondays 9am–12.50pm, Morton 201 |  
| Student hours  | Tuesdays 10am–noon, Morton 208 |  

In this class, we will explore the computer as a tool capable of powerful creative possibility, not via pre-built software, but instead by writing code ourselves. We will look at the basic structures and affordances of code as inspiration for making artworks, as a tool capable of creating things that would be impossible by hand, and as a fallible system that encapsulates our cultural and personal biases.

During the course of the semester, you’ll learn how to write code for a variety of visual projects, including image, text, and interaction. We’ll primarily be using [`p5.js`](https://p5js.org), an offshoot of Processing (which turns twenty years old this year!) that was originally developed by [Lauren McCarthy](https://lauren-mccarthy.com). `p5.js` is a toolkit created specifically for artists and designers build on the Javascript programming language and features a really [easy-to-use online code editor](https://editor.p5js.org).

Along the way, we’ll also look at historical and contemporary figures in the arts and computer science who have shaped how we use computers as creative tools, and we’ll explore code from a critical, humanistic perspective.

See the [syllabus PDF](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CreativeProgramming1/blob/master/Syllabus.pdf) for course policies, grading, etc.

### FORMAT  
This semester we're finally back together in person! Our class time will be spent together critiquing your homework projects, covering technical material, introducing new assignments, looking at examples, group ideation and feedback exercises, and work time. Attendance will be taken at the start of class every week.

Because we will cover a lot of material this semester and because this course will be both rigorous and thorough, it’s really important that you stay on top of your coursework. 

:warning: **Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions at all! Better to ask a question than be unsure of something.**

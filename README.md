# CREATIVE PROGRAMMING 1

**[:arrow_down: Jump right to the Course Calendar :arrow_down:](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CreativeProgramming1#course-calendar)**  
 
| Instructor     | Prof. Jeff Thompson (please call me Jeff) |  
| :---           | :--- |  
| Email          | jeff.thompson@stevens.edu |  
| Student hours  | On Zoom, Wed 10am–noon EST and by appointment |  
| Drop-in hours  | Tuesdays 9–11am EST |  
| Weekly crits   | Tuesdays 11am–12:30pm EST |  
| Zoom links     | ^^^ links for the above meetings on Canvas |  

In this class, we will explore the computer as a tool capable of powerful creative possibility, not via pre-built software, but instead by writing code ourselves. We will look at the basic structures and affordances of code as inspiration for making artworks, as a tool capable of creating things that would be impossible by hand, and as a fallible system that encapsulates our cultural and personal biases.

During the course of the semester, you’ll learn how to write code for a variety of visual projects, including image, text, and interaction. We’ll primarily be using [`p5.js`](https://p5js.org), an offshoot of Processing originally developed by [Lauren McCarthy](https://lauren-mccarthy.com). `p5.js` is a toolkit created specifically for artists and designers build on the Javascript programming language and features a really [easy-to-use online code editor](https://editor.p5js.org).

Along the way, we’ll also look at historical and contemporary figures in the arts and computer science who have shaped how we use computers as creative tools, and we’ll explore code from a critical, humanistic perspective.

See the [syllabus PDF](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CreativeProgramming1/blob/master/Syllabus.pdf) for course policies, grading, etc.


### FORMAT/ATTENDANCE  
Of course, this semester is quite unusual! While normally we’d be hanging out in a classroom together, this semester our class will be all online. We lose some things in that process but we also gain some: an online class means you can learn at your own pace and on your schedule, review materials as much as you like, make projects that can be shared online, and we can find creative ways to make and discuss art together, even if we're not physically in the same room.

Our main format will be:  
* Weekly examples, available as code you can run online as well as video tutorials in a YouTube playlist  
* Weekly homework projects that you’ll work on independently and turn in on Canvas  
* Regular group critiques of projects on Zoom at 11am EST – attendance taken!    
* Drop-in hours during class and office hours; this is so you can ask more detailed questions, get help with your homework, etc  

Where to find everything:  
* Canvas: a good starting point to find assignments, links to video tutorials, and where you’ll turn in homework  
* Github: all course materials including detailed assignments, code examples, images, etc  

Because of this format and the technical nature of this class, it’s really important that you stay on top of your coursework. 

:warning: **Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions at all! Better to ask a question than be unsure of something. I also really (truly!) want to hear from you all on what is working and what’s not in the online format. I can’t know what it’s like to be on your end of things unless you tell me, so please do!**  

Watching video tutorials, looking at code examples, and doing your homework will be on your own schedule but attendance at critiques is mandatory and attendance will be taken.
